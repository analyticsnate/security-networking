### create listener job that discovers when the pi hard drive is present - done
then downloads the data and log files from it to the laptop for 
longer term storage - maybe load into a database

https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux


### set some flag to false after running that kills the listener process - done
set this flag to true when a new job is run to tell the laptop to gather data and logs


# create mysql database to load this data
set up hourly cron job to load this data into the mysql database
this is necessary for long term storage of this data in a compact format


### later down the line
program the pi to connect to the laptop via wifi or bluetooth(?) and stream data into the database
be able to start/stop this streaming from the laptop


### also
build analytics for data
create way to do supervised machine learning by logging what is happening to the sensor to train the model


### after all this is set up 
start exploring computer vision...
